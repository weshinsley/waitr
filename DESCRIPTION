Title: More precise delays for animations
Version: 1.0
Author: Wes Hinsley [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Wes Hinsley <wes.hinsley@gmail.com>
Description: Wait for (delay), or wait until (time).
    Intended as a more precise version of Sys.sleep(),
    which seems to have a slight overheard, such that Sys.sleep(0.01)
    behaves about the same as Sys.sleep(0.02), but removing
    the Sys.sleep altogether makes much more of a difference.
